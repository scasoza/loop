# Experiment Evidence Explorer

A lightweight Vite + React dashboard that visualizes how interventions influence observations over time. It pairs a time-series chart with a React Flow mindmap to keep goals, hypotheses/experiments, evidence, and outcomes in sync.

## Features
- **Recharts time series** plotting observations vs. intervention intensity.
- **React Flow mindmap** linking goals → hypotheses/experiments → evidence/outcomes.
- **Status badges and confidence indicators** computed from observation evidence.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app serves at http://localhost:5173 by default.
